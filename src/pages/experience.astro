        From streamlining complex systems to designing creative solutions, I focus on using technology to solve
        real-world problems. Whether leading the migration of development workflows to GitHub, building and maintaining
        reliable systems for more efficient information systems, or designing automation tools that simplify business
        tasks, I bring a hands-on, problem-solving approach to every challenge. My experience spans technical recovery
        efforts that saved businesses thousands, creating data-driven strategies to guide better decisions, and even
        building websites and social media campaigns that connect people and amplify impact. With a passion for
        innovation and a focus on results, Iâ€™m dedicated to building solutions that make life easier, more efficient,
        and more engaging.

            I led a migration to GitHub, which helped improve collaboration and teamwork across the organization. I
            designed and implemented CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions to make deployments more efficient. I also
            created automation workflows with APIs to streamline repetitive tasks and boost productivity. Using Python,
            I analyzed data to support better business decisions, and I developed processes for extracting and
            transforming SQL data to simplify reporting and analytics. Additionally, I built a program to handle mass
            file deletions more effectively, improving overall system performance.

            I assisted in managing a fleet of gaming computers, ensuring reliable performance and minimizing technical
            issues to create a better user experience. I also led disaster recovery efforts for a bowling center,
            implementing effective solutions to safeguard operations and prevent financial losses. These experiences
            allowed me to develop a hands-on approach to troubleshooting and a strong ability to handle critical
            situations effectively.

            I designed a new website from the ground up, creating a more engaging and user-friendly experience while
            improving search engine visibility. I also managed social media platforms, successfully growing audience
            engagement and expanding the organization's reach. In addition, I designed event flyers that helped
            streamline marketing efforts, reducing outsourcing costs. To support operations, I engineered a new hosting
            solution that lowered expenses while maintaining reliability. These efforts allowed me to combine creativity
            with technical expertise to drive meaningful results.

            I managed a technology help service designed for seniors with disabilities, focusing on
            providing accessible and effective support. I took the initiative to expand the program's outreach, ensuring
            that more individuals could benefit from the services offered. Additionally, I conducted in-depth research
            to identify the best assistive technology products for individuals with disabilities, allowing the program
            to better meet their needs and enhance their access to essential tools.

            I directed a technology class for seniors, focusing on fostering their confidence and skills in using
            digital
            technology. I taught essential skills such as using social media to keep in contact with family and loved
            ones. I also took the lead in reprovisioning non-functional computers at the organization, ensuring
            they were accessible to seniors, thereby supporting their engagement with technology in a meaningful way.
