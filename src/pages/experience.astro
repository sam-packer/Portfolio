            <p>
                I’ve always been drawn to the idea of using technology to advance businesses and their needs. Whether
                it’s improving the workflow for developers and businesses or building applications that are intuitive
                and fast to use, I enjoy developing solutions that matter. Over the years, I’ve tackled many complex
                challenges and needs, such as leading disaster recovery efforts that have saved thousands of dollars,
                orchestrating complex database designs to steer smarter decision making, and building websites that are
                a delight to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                My passions and goals are not just about building things to achieve a task. It’s about going the extra
                mile to create solutions that feel intuitive, meaningful, and are a joy to interact with. I want to
                build systems and tools that don’t just achieve the bare minimum for a task, but make people’s lives
                better. The impact that I create by putting other people's needs is the most important factor when
                developing a new process and fuels my purpose and passion.
