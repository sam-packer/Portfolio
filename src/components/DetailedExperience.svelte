        I led a migration to GitHub, which helped improve collaboration and teamwork across the organization. I
        designed and implemented CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions to make deployments more efficient. I also
        created automation workflows with APIs to eliminate repetitive tasks and free up worker time. Using
        Python,
        I analyzed data to create reports and support better business decision making. I have worked with
        advanced
        processes and delivering data and reports to cross-functional teams. Additionally, I built a program to
        handle mass file deletions more effectively, reducing the crash rate and runtime for the process.

        I assisted in managing a fleet of gaming computers, ensuring reliable performance and minimizing
        technical
        issues to create a better customer experience. I also led disaster recovery efforts for the bowling
        center,
        implementing a backup strategy to safeguard operations and prevent significant financial losses. These
        experiences allowed me to develop a hands-on approach to troubleshooting and a strong ability to handle
        critical situations effectively.

    >
        I had the opportunity to redesign the website for Mission 2540, a nonprofit dedicated to supporting
        low-income individuals through various activities and programs. As part of a business proposal for my
        technical communication class, my team proposed a website overhaul to improve functionality and
        engagement.
        I created an initial prototype, which was well received, and then refined it into a polished final
        version.
        The redesign included a more intuitive structure, enhanced visuals, and the integration of a payment
        system
        to support donations to the organization. It was a rewarding experience to apply my skills in a way that
        directly benefits an organization making a meaningful impact.

        I designed a new website from the ground up, creating a more engaging and user-friendly experience while
        improving search engine visibility. I also managed all of the social media platforms, successfully
        growing
        audience engagement and expanding the organization's reach. In addition, I designed event flyers that
        helped
        boost new enrollment for the ensemble. To support operations, I engineered a new hosting
        solution that lowered expenses while maintaining reliability. These efforts allowed me to combine
        creativity
        with technical expertise to bring down costs significantly.

    >
        I had the opportunity to be a guest lecturer for Buffteks, where I spoke about securing Linux with
        firewalls, setting up a VPN, and using SSH keys. While these security fundamentals were important, my
        main
        focus was showcasing Caddy, a powerful web server that simplifies web development and reduces the Linux
        learning curve. I demonstrated how Caddy automates tasks like HTTPS certificate generation and showcased
        the
        template system. The purpose was to encourage developers to do more with simpler tools. It was great to
        engage with the club and share how Caddy can make deploying and managing websites much easier.

        I led a technology help service designed for seniors with disabilities. The focus was on
        providing expertise what technologies were best for each individual and how to use those technologies. I
        took the initiative to start the program from the ground up. I expanded the program's outreach from no
        awareness to helping multiple people weekly. Additionally, I conducted in-depth research to identify the
        best assistive technology products for individuals with disabilities, which was published into a
        categorized
        and simple to follow catalog.

        I directed a technology class for seniors, focusing on fostering their confidence and skills in using
        digital technology. I taught essential skills such as using social media to keep in contact with family
        and
        loved ones. I also helped them with technical issues such as Wi-Fi not working or syncing photos from a
        phone to a computer. I also took the lead in reprovisioning non-functional computers at the
        organization,
        ensuring they were accessible to seniors, thereby supporting their engagement with technology in a
        meaningful way.
