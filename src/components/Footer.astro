    If JS isn't enabled, the user will see a mismatch of years until a new build after the new year
    This is due to a mix of SSR and SSG within Astro. However, the majority of users have JS enabled,
    so this is truly a small edge case for users without JS and only until a new build has been initiated
    after the new year.
