I built a drag-and-drop form builder using Astro and Svelte, designed to modernize survey creation and management. The
application includes user authentication, allowing individuals to create, edit, and delete surveys by assembling
components in an intuitive interface. Once published, surveys can be shared for respondents to complete, and all
responses are collected for analysis. This project combines efficient frontend interactivity with a structured backend
to deliver a seamless experience for both creators and respondents.
