I led a team of 8 developers to rewrite and optimize a Minecraft plugin, improving efficiency, reducing bloat, making it modular, and integrating robust infrastructure with CI/CD pipelines and documentation. Directed development strategy, implemented scalable solutions with database and caching systems, and authored comprehensive project documentation.
