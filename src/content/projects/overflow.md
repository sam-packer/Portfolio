I built a Q&A platform similar to StackOverflow. The goal was to create a place where people could ask questions and
share knowledge effectively. I set up a system that allows users to create and respond to threads, making it easy to
follow conversations on various topics.

One of the key features I added was an advanced search function. This helps users quickly find specific threads or
posts, which makes the site more user-friendly and efficient. To keep everything organized and easy to navigate, I also
implemented pagination, so users can browse through content smoothly without getting overwhelmed.

For user management, I built a robust system that supports all the basic functions like creating, reading, updating, and
deleting profiles and posts. This allows users to manage their accounts and contributions easily, which is crucial for
keeping the platform active and engaging.
