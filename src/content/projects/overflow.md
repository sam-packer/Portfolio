I built a Q&A platform similar to StackOverflow. The goal was to create a place where people could ask questions and
share knowledge effectively. I set up a system that allows users to create and respond to threads, making it easy to
follow conversations on various topics.

One of the key features I added was an advanced search function. This helps users quickly find specific threads or
posts, which makes their experience more pleasant and enjoyable. To keep everything organized and easy to navigate, I
also implemented pagination, so users can browse through content smoothly without getting overwhelmed.

For user management, I built a system that supports all the basic functions like creating, reading, updating, and
deleting profiles and posts. This solid framework allows for expansion into more advance tools such as content
moderation.
