I designed and developed a comprehensive Mailroom Management System tailored for apartment complexes to streamline package tracking and resident communication. The system allows property managers to efficiently monitor incoming packages, authenticate users, and notify residents of deliveries via email notifications.

#### User Management
A robust user management module allows administrators to create, update, and manage resident and staff accounts with varying levels of access.

#### Package Management
Managers can log, track, and update the status of packages in real-time, ensuring accurate and up-to-date records.

#### Authentication & Security
Implemented JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to ensure secure access to the system, safeguarding sensitive data and user information.

#### Email Notification Support
Integrated email notifications to automatically alert residents when their packages are received and ready for pickup, enhancing communication and convenience.

#### Database Integration
Utilized MySQL as the backend database to store and manage user data, package details, and system logs efficiently.

Built using .NET 8.0, the system leverages ASP.NET Core and Razor Pages for a seamless and responsive user interface. This solution not only simplifies package management for property managers but also improves the overall resident experience by reducing delays and ensuring timely delivery notifications.
