I designed and developed a Mailroom Management System tailored for apartment complexes to track packages and improve resident communication. The system allows property managers to monitor packages that have been delivered and picked up, but also notify residents of deliveries via email notifications.

#### User Management
A robust user management module allows property managers to create, update, and manage resident information.

#### Package Management
Both managers and residents can track the status of packages, which reduces wasted space by packages that haven't been picked up.

#### Authentication & Security
I implemented JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication with .NET to ensure secure access to the system, safeguarding sensitive data and user information.

#### Email Notification Support
I integrated email notifications for residents to alert them when their packages are delivered to the front office and ready for pickup. This gives residents clearer communication while reducing wasted space in the office for property managers.

#### Database Integration
MySQL was used as the backend database to store and manage the user data and package history.

This project was built with ASP.NET Core and Razor Pages for a seamless and responsive user interface. This solution not only simplifies package management for property managers but also improves the overall resident experience by reducing delays and ensuring timely delivery notifications.
