As the Lead Developer, I directed a team of 8 developers in a full-scale rewrite of a Minecraft plugin, which led to
significant improvements in performance, scalability, and maintainability. By refactoring the codebase,
my team and I eliminated inefficiencies, reduced technical debt, and introduced a modular architecture to enhance
flexibility and future extensibility. I established a robust infrastructure, built a CI/CD pipelines to simplify
deployment, and also prioritized the creation of comprehensive documentation to support long-term project
sustainability.

I guided the development strategy, leading my team to create scalable solutions such as a better database structure
and advanced caching mechanisms to improve system performance and reliability. Through iterative development cycles and
close collaboration with my team, I ensured alignment with project goals and timely delivery of milestones. My
leadership fostered a culture of openness and efficiency, resulting in a high-quality, maintainable product that
exceeded both technical and functional objectives.
