Today at the 2025 WTAMU Business Symposium, I was honored to have been inducted into Beta Gamma Sigma, an international
honor society recognizing the top business schools, and Upsilon Pi Epsilon, a prestigious society celebrating excellence
in computing and information disciplines. Both of these recognitions inspire me to continue striving for academic and
professional excellence.

I’m also humbled to receive the Buffteks Leadership Award, presented by Carl Zhang and the 2025 Carey Lyles Emerging
Technology Award, presented by Liang Chen. I have been honored to give guest lectures for Buffteks and have
enjoyed meeting many wonderful students and sharing my knowledge and inspiring others.

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone throughout my time at West Texas A&M University. I have had the
wonderful opportunity to meet many incredible students and supportive faculty who have all made my journey
unforgettable, with a special gratitude to Carl Zhang and Liang Chen for your belief in my potential through these
awards. Your encouragement has been a driving force.

This fall, I’ll begin a new chapter in my life by pursuing a Masters in Artificial Intelligence at Duke University. I'm
honored to have this opportunity to continue my education and promote positive change for everyone. Technology is my
passion, but none of this would be possible without the inspiring community at WTAMU, which has fueled my curiosity and
growth.
